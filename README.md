# Weather_app
My first JavaScript Project


Firstly https://developer.accuweather.com I have to create account.
Then I added new app for get api key. I clicked API REFERENCE, chose Locations API and Forecast API. After that chose Text Search-City Search. After paste api key, searched Adana as city.I passed Forecast API page and after paste spesific key, I got url.
I worked in Visual Studio Code and used Javascript, Css, Html. Shortly my project will show Adana's daily weather.
